The **Cineminha** (Portuguese diminutive for cinema) is a _**tiny home cinema**_ room built in a space of just 6.72 square meters, a spare room in a three bedroom apartment located in Campinas, Brazil. It has two seats, with an approximate viewing distance of 2 meters from a 55" screen and features a spatial sound system with 5.1.2 channels. Its illumination system has two sets of lights, one cold (primary ceiling spots) and one warm (secondary dimmable back wall sconces and front ceiling spots), providing two different ambiances according to how room is being used. It has an automation system which makes possible to control all electronic devices and room illumination, including syncronization of film play/pause with lights off/on. An air conditioner provides cool and heat climatization options. With walls painted in a dark tone to avoid reflections from screen light, alongside with black furniture and a blackout curtain, provides a very immersive visual experience, even during daylight times. It is fully decorated with film posters, theater signs, movie memorabilia, books and posters with famous film quotes. A collection of a few hundred titles of Blu-ray discs and DVDs, a few dozen soundtrack CDs and some film books completes the film loving experience.
